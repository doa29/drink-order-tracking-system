# drink-order-tracking-system
This Java-based project implements an infrastructure system for a dry bar, where users can order drinks like iced tea and coffee, track sugar content, and calculate the total bill. Built using Test Driven Development (TDD), the system ensures high code quality and reduces bugs by testing every feature as it's developed.
